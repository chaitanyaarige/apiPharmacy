1. save user password in encrypted form in customer column
2. do not register duplicate email id
3. Initially not necessary  ?? send jwt token generated after user requests for signin - and store in DB auth_tokens
4. ask client to send Jwt token on every request, if verified then send the response - verify by expiration time and user ID
5. check if the user can save same token, for multiple tabs (Is it required like bank - no new tab)
6. Login with  phone number too...  request.body.phone ? then verify user number in user DB
7. Ask for common loopholes
8. how do you logout - req.session.user = null ?
9. send a email, if forgot-user api is hit
10. EDIT - update USER details - except phone number (one phone - one user)

POINT - 3 above has {
  function isLoggedIn (req, res, next) {
  if (!(req.session && req.session.user)) {
    return res.send('Not logged in!');
  }
  next();

  //somewhere else
  app.get("/api", isLoggedIn, function (req, res) {
   //Something private
})
}
}
5. forgot_pasword_token {}
